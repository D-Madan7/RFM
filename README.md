## **📊 Understanding RFM Analysis**  

**1️⃣ Recency (R)** → *How recently has the customer made a purchase?*  
**2️⃣ Frequency (F)** → *How often does the customer purchase?*  
**3️⃣ Monetary (M)** → *How much has the customer spent?*  

The system assigns **RFM scores (1-5)** to each customer based on these metrics, enabling **customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies**.
